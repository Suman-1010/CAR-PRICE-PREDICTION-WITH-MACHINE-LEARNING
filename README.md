## About
This project is a car price prediction model built using machine learning techniques. It predicts the price of a car based on various features, such as brand, model, horsepower, and mileage. Car price prediction is a common use case in machine learning and data analysis.

### Prerequisites

- Python (>=3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for data exploration)
- Required Python libraries (Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.)

### Installation
Install the required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
### Data Collection
Collect a dataset of car listings with features such as brand, model, horsepower, mileage, year, etc. (Include information on data sources if applicable.)
### Data Preprocessing
Clean the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the data.
Convert categorical variables into numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Normalize or scale numerical features if needed.
### Model Training
Choose an appropriate regression algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) for car price prediction.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the selected model on the training dataset.
### Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared on the test dataset.
Visualize the predicted vs. actual prices to assess model accuracy.
